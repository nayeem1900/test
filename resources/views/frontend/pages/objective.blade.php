                        We are a trained professional that advises clients throughout the permitting process to keep construction projects on schedule and within budget. Our Expediters typically have backgrounds in Planning, Construction, Real Estate, or Architecture and have experience working with local compliance codes and zoning requirements.<br>
                        Pushing back project deadlines can result in massive overspending.Permit Expediters understand this and are hired to navigate the permit process quickly and smoothly to prevent overspending. We do this by reducing the number of required plan checks, negotiating quicker review times, and utilizing existing relationships with jurisdictions to obtain information quicker.<br>
                        AR Management Corporation takes a strategic approach to handling the permit expediting process. Rather than simply acting as a liaison between jurisdictions and architects, we take a hands-on approach by presenting solutions to problems that arise during the permitting process. If a plan reviewer determines that there is an issue with building plans, we come up with solutions such as alternative designs and methods to overcoming the situation. We become part of our client’s team and make it our mission to achieve our client’s goals. We take communication seriously, providing weekly updates to ensure all team members are up to date throughout the entire process.
